# ATM Backend System

This project is a simple **ATM backend system** developed in Java.  
It allows users to:

- Create a new account with a holder name and initial balance
- Login to their account using account number
- View current balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- View last 5 transactions (mini statement)

**Technologies used:**

- Java (OOP concepts and Collections)
- JDBC for database connectivity
- MySQL for storing account and transaction data
- Eclipse IDE / VS Code

**Features:**

- Fully functional backend logic for ATM operations
- Database records for account details and transactions
- Console-based user interface

**Note:** This project is backend-focused. A web or GUI frontend can be added later to make it a full-stack application.
